# Duration-guard cancel race (item #2 in 2026-05-22 IMPORTANT review batch)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When cancel_scan() runs mid-scan it sets _stop_evt and calls source.close().
# The duration guard's poll loop then exits its sleep early and (previously)
# unconditionally re-ran stop_trigger + sleep(0.35) + source.close(). On real
# hardware the second close ran against torn-down USB endpoints; in tests the
# guard would also block on a full _batch_queue sentinel slot.
# The fix: the guard checks whether the source is already closing (via
# source._stop.is_set()) and exits without duplicate work.

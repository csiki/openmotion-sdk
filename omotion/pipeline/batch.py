"""FrameBatch — the typed data carrier that flows through all pipeline stages.

Each stage's docstring states which fields it owns. Stages mutate the batch
in place for performance (no per-batch allocation churn). Tests assert field
ownership: only the owning stage writes a given field.

All per-frame fields are numpy arrays of shape (N, ...). N is the batch
size — typically 10-100 frames per batch from LiveUsbSource.
